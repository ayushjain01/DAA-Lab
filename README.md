# DAA-Lab
This Repository contains program files for Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab, semester 4.

## Questions -
1. The goods packages in a supermarket are assigned an integer label. Write a C 
 program to sort the set of goods packages based on label identifier using Bubble 
Sort/Selection Sort and determine the time required to sort. Plot a graph of number
of label identifiers versus time taken.

2. A library maintains details of N books where every book is assigned a unique ISBN.
Develop a program in C to sort the books based on ISBN using merge sort technique.
Determine the time required to sort. Repeat the experiment for different values of N
and plot a graph of the time taken versus N.

3. Consider a list of ‘n’ files numbered using ID’s. Write a C program to sort files based
on its ID using Quick sort. Determine the time required sort the files. Plot a graph of
number of IDs versus time taken.

4. Design and develop a program in C to print all the nodes reachable from a given
starting node in a digraph by using BFS method. Give the trace of this algorithm.

5. A university is looking for engineering graduates, they need to sort the candidate‘s
resume based on their ranking. Write a C program to sort the resumes by using heap
sort. Determine the time required to sort the elements. Plot a graph of number of
elements versus time taken. Specify the time efficiency class of this algorithm.

6. Consider the problem of searching for genes in DNA sequences. A DNA sequence is
represented by a text using alphabets [A, C, G, T]. Design a ‘C’ program to locate a
pattern in a given DNA sequence using Horsepool’s algorithm. Give the trace of this
algorithm.

7. Consider a network of ‘n’ systems represented as a Graph. Write a ‘C’ program to find
the transitive closure of such a network using Warshall’s algorithm. Give the trace
of this algorithm.

8. Suppose in a network of cities, you are interested in finding shortest paths between
all cities. Design a ‘C’ program to implement this using Floyd’s algorithm. Give the
trace of this algorithm.

9. Given ‘N’ items with their weight and value. Also, a bag is given whose capacity in
‘W’. Write a C program based on dynamic programming design technique to find the
subset of items that fit into the bag and earn maximum profit. Give the trace of this
algorithm.

10. Given ‘N’ items with their weight and value. Also, a bag is given whose capacity in
‘W’. Write a C program based on dynamic programming design technique to find the
subset of items that fit into the bag and earn maximum profit. Give the trace of this
algorithm.

11. Given a weighted connected graph of N cities, Write a C program to find shortest
paths from a given city to all other cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. Give the trace of
this algorithm.

12. A hostel building is designed with NxN rooms and there are N students for whom
the room is to be allotted. Design a C program to allot the students to these rooms
using N-queen’s method such that no two students are allotted rooms in same row,
column or diagonal. Give the trace of this algorithm.
